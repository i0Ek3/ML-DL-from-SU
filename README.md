# ML-DL-from-SU

> Stanford University Machine Learning and Deep Learning Course by Andrew Ng.

Something I learned from Andrew Ng, that's really amazing. And the notes just modified from PhD Huang and I fixed some typos. 

The files under the code/tf-example/ just from TensorFlow docs, I make some changes and they all worked well, I just checked it.

Of course, before you execute these files please be sure you have required dependices. 

Have fun, always updating!

## Issues

### When I run `python3 xxx.py`, the terminal show me below message:

```
âžœ python3 basic_image_classify.py
[1, 2, 3, 4]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "basic_image_classify.py", line 6, in <module>
    import tensorflow as tf
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/__init__.py", line 101, in <module>
    from tensorflow_core import *
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/__init__.py", line 40, in <module>
    from tensorflow.python.tools import module_util as _module_util
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow.python.tools'; 'tensorflow.python' is not a package
```
Just remove some non-relative .py files and folders or rename some files, then the command will work again. I don't know why but it really worked!

### `griddata` removed from matlablib, use `scipy.interpolate.griddata`.
